# n-puzzle

N-puzzle is algorithmic project after algorithm branch at School 21.

The goal of the project is to implementthe A* algorithm and three different heuristics to resolve a simple game named "taquin".

It starts with a square board consisting of N*N cells. One of these cells will be empty, the rest will contain numbers, starting from 1, which will be unique in this instance of the puzzle.

The program search algorithm will have to find a valid sequence of moves in order to reach an end state, also known as a "snail's solution", which depends on the size of the puzzle.
